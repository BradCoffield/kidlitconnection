  <div class="col-5" style="text-align: left;">Ben is an actor, composer, singer, musician, and all-around super guy from Birmingham, Alabama. I attended many of his classical piano performances (when he was a teen). He has a BFA in musical theatre, and works professionally as an actor, musician, and vocalist. I commissioned him to write, compose, sing, play, and record a song for my virtual book launch that was held on the book's release date, 11-5-2021. Here's Ben's original song, "Montana," inspired by my debut children's picture book, Montana's Memory Day. His website is <a href="https://www.benctidwell.com" target="_blank">benctidwell.com</a>. </div>
