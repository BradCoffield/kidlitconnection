<p>I'd love to add your name to my email list. You'll receive only the occasional email; like, when I publish my next children's book, or, to let you know when our regional SCBWI Montana team is hosting a kidlit conference I think you might be interested in. I'll never sell or share your contact information with anyone. It's only for my benefit so I can keep you in the loop about kidlit stuff.</p>
