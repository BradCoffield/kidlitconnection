									<h2>My Books</h2>
									<p class="kalam">I'm so happy you're here to learn more about my forthcoming book as well as my WWII themed work-in-progress!</p>
									
								</header>
								<p>I write kidlit for preschoolers to middle graders—from fiction to nonfiction—but, in all my
									books one thing shows through: they’re all rooted in the truth in some way.</p>
									<p>
										Montana’s Memory Day is a realistic fiction picture book for ages 5 and up inspired by a
compilation of the life stories of several real people.
									</p>
									<p>
										My WWII-themed work-in-progress is nonfiction for ages 8-12. It’s about two women who
worked behind-the-scenes doing top secret work for America’s government during wartime.
									</p>
								<h3 class="funderline"><em>Montana's Memory Day</em></h3>
								<p>My debut picture book, Montana’s Memory Day, is a nature-themed foster-to-adoption story set
									on a farm in Montana. It is being illustrated by 2-time published illustrator, Erika Wilson, who is
									also a 3 rd generation Montana farmer, small business owner, former educator, and mom.
									Montana’s Memory Day will launch in the fall of 2021 from Mascot Books.</p>
								<p>I wrote this book to fulfill a need. I did not grow up as a foster kid, but I married two men who
									did. That is why I wrote this story—to give voice to older foster kids and teens who are grossly
									underrepresented in children’s books today. I struggled to find comparable titles that highlight
									the mixed feelings and inner struggles of this demographic in a relatable and understandable
									way. When I couldn’t find such a story, I wrote one.</p>
									<p>Illustrating a picture book is an artform. Once completed, Erika will have spent 14 months and
										hundreds of hours illustrating Montana’s Memory Day using a linocut print and watercolor
										method that she designed. In the video she’s carving one of the book’s page spreads out of lino
										(short for linoleum). It’s a meticulous and time-intensive task that she enjoys (she says!).</p>
										<p>You can find out more about Erika Wilson at these locations.

					<p>Peggy Davis and Mildred Mahan were not alike. They weren’t friends, either. In fact, they barely
						knew each other. But, for 18 months in the 1940’s, these cousins from Alabama shared an
						apartment while working for separate top government organizations in Washington, DC.		</p>
<p>

							They never talked about the work they did—not even to each other. They had been sworn to
							secrecy and weren’t allowed to talk about it or write about it—to anyone. But, what they did
							behind-the-scenes was top secret work and highly classified and forever impacted the course of
							America’s national and military history.

									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p class="kalam">Hello, I’m Sue Lawrence, writer and reader of children’s picture books that encourage, inform,
										and inspire.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<img src="images/fromSue/Sue Lawrence, 08-24-2020_resized.jpg" alt="" class="mw300">
									<p>
										My debut picture book, <em>Montana's Memory Day</em>, is currently being illustrated
										by SCBWI Montana’s Regional Illustrator, Erika Wilson, and will launch fall, 2021. This foster-
										to-adoption story is set in the middle of a Montana winter using an illustration method that (to
										the best of Erika’s knowledge) has never been done before to illustrate a children’s picture book.
										MMD will be published by Mascot Books, a hybrid book publisher in Herndon, VA.
									</p>
									<p>
										My writing journey has been a roundabout one. I wrote poetry and a play as a teen in Alabama
										and won 1 st place in a creative writing contest at my high school when I was 17. Then I didn’t
										write again until I was in my 50’s and trying to transition out of healthcare. I joined critique
										groups, took non-credit college courses, entered every writing contest I could find, and attended
										writer’s conferences with stay-awake-all-night excitement. I was fortunate enough to win a few
										of those writing contests. I also racked up enough rejection letters to wallpaper a kitchen.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, after working as a Registered Nurse for over 40 years (including college), I gave away or
										threw away all my belongings except for what would fit in my car, and drove 1,900 miles night
										and day from AL to MT to attend college, second time around. I arrived at Rocky Mountain
										College sight-unseen, three hours before the fall registration start time. This time, I majored in
										English: creative writing and soaked up the college experience with new college friends one-
										third my age. I don’t believe God gives us do-overs, but I’m a strong believer in the “do anew”!
									</p>

									</p>
									<p>
										When I earned my BA degree over a year ago at the age of 60, I was the oldest graduate to cross
										the commencement stage to receive my diploma. I liked the college so much I now work for it by
										day—as a writer, and write my kidlit at night.
									</p>
									<p>
										I’ve been an active member of SCBWI (Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators)
										since 2016, and am SCBWI Montana’s volunteer Instagram social media maven.
									</p>
									<p sty>
										Montana is home now — It’s no surprise that my debut picture book is Montana-themed. I love
										this scenic state and its hard-working folk. I admit—it took me way too long to get here, but
										sometimes the long ‘round-about scenic route’s the best one, anyway. I speak from
										experience—you CAN reroute your life’s GPS at any age. Yes, at ANY age!
