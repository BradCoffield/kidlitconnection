recommendation_content: American dippers are unassuming, happy-go-lucky little
  dark-gray birds specific to the Pacific Northwest’s fast-moving streams. It is
  the only North American songbird that swims underwater and it’s a year-round
  resident of Montana. I was so impressed with the adaptability and resilience
  of this little bird I just had to include one in my upcoming debut picture
  book, Montana’s Memory Day, scheduled to launch in the fall of 2021.
