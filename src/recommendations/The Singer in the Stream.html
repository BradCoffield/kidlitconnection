moving streams. It is the only North American songbird that swims underwater and it’s a year-round resident of
Montana. I was so impressed with the adaptability and resilience of this little bird I just had to include one in my
upcoming debut picture book, Montana’s Memory Day, scheduled to launch in the fall of 2021.'
